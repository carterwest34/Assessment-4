//1. Create a class called School. Give it properties to model:
// -the name of the school
// -the number of students that attend
// -if it is a public or private school
// -the year it was built
//
// Add a function called schoolDescription to the School class that will print out "\(name of school) was founded in \(the year it was built) and has \(number of students) currently in attendance"

// Create an instance of school and then call it's schoolDescription function

//BONUS: Create a new Date() object that represents the current date. Create a date formatter and set the custom date format for it. Use the date formatter to create a formatted String from the date object, and print the formatted String.
